This repository holds various DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) which target various (primarily technical) domains.

These DSLs are implemented using Xtext version 1.0.x (see http://xtext.org/) and Eclipse 3.6.y and serve both as a personal portfolio as well as a show case for various aspects of DSL implementation using Xtext.
