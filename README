This repository holds various DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) which target various (primarily technical) domains.

These DSLs are implemented using Xtext version 1.0.x (see http://xtext.org/) and Eclipse 3.6.y and serve both as a personal portfolio as well as a show case for various aspects of DSL implementation using Xtext.

In any case, most of the source code in this repo is generated by the Xtext framework (and to a much lesser extent: Eclipse) anyway, so the actual interesting code is relatively small in size. The interesting bits can be found mostly in the src/ part of the non-.ui projects.


INSTALLATION

The direct sub directories in this repository are Eclipse 3.6(.1) plugin projects which can be pulled and imported using Eclipse's Import wizard. Several projects have a hard dependency on some of the other plugin projects, which can be satisfied by deploying those projects as plugins into the dropins/ sub directory of your Eclipse installation and restarting Eclipse. (I'll make this slightly easier along the way.)


LICENSE

Since it's my intention that these examples can be used by other folks, whether for commercial purposes or not, I distribute this under the MIT license, as expressed by the LICENSE file.


OVERVIEW

Below I'll give an overview of the various DSLs:

1) nl.dslmeinte.xtext.examples.data => DSL for doing data modeling, including declaration of constraints (not actual specification).
2) nl.dslmeinte.xtext.examples.dynamic => DSL for specifying dynamic screens - this DSL depends on the DataDsl (1) to be able to refer to an existing data model.
3) nl.dslmeinte.xtext.examples.xsd => DSL for specifying XML Schema Definitions, or rather: a sub set thereof.
4) nl.dslmeinte.xtext.examples.wsdl => DSL for specifying WSDL, or rather: a sub class thereof - this DSL depends on the XsdDsl (3) to refer to XSDs.
